# CRESCENT-CPAL

**CRESCENT-CPAL** is a repository developed to support the Cascadia Paleoseismology Working Group ([CPAL](https://cascadiaquakes.org/cpal/)) within the [CRESCENT project](https://cascadiaquakes.org/). This repository provides data and tools for geoscientists working with CPAL data.

## Features

### **Data Files** 

- The original data files are in Microsoft Excel format and are stored in the `excel/` folder.
- These files are converted to GeoJSON format for web-based visualization and are stored in the `geojson/` folder.
- Corresponding JSON files that provide field descriptions and column display controls for the web interface are stored in the `json/` folder.
- Raw data are available from Staisch, L.M., Witter, R.C., Watt, J.T., Grant, A.R., Walton, M.A., Brothers, D., Davis, E., Dura, C., Engelhart, S., Enkin, R., Garrison-Laney, C.E, Goldfinger, C., Hamilton, T., Hawkes, A., Hill, J.C., Hong, I.J., Jaffe, B.E., Kelsey, H., Lahusen, S.R, La Selle, S.M, Nelson, A.R, Nieminski, N.M, Padgett, J.S, Patton, J., Pearl, J.K, Pilarczyk, J., Sherrod, B., and Stanton, K., 2024, Compiled onshore and offshore paleoseismic data along the Cascadia Subduction zone: U.S. Geological Survey data release, [https://doi.org/10.5066/P13OJQYW](https://doi.org/10.5066/P13OJQYW).

### **Scripts** 

Under the `scripts` directory, two `Python` helper tools are provided to convert the data and description files to the corresponding `GeoJSON` and `JSON` files respectively. For information on how to use these scripts, see the guides under the scripts directory.
