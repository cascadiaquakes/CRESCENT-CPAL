Several tens of cm of peat and mud separate 1700 CE from 1964 CE. 1700 CE deposit sits within a uniform sequence of intertidal peat which grades down into mud. Oldest possible tsunami deposit dated is between ~600-1000 cal yr BP. Eight older sand layers penetrated with a sonic drill hole in Port Alberni marsh (Clague and Bobrowsky, 1994b) although subsurface spatial distribution is unknown. They do resemble the 1964 CE and 1700 CE. Range in age from 2000-3500 yrs old. Clague and Bobrowsky (1994b). Tanigawa et al. (2022) constrain an upper sand as 1964 based on 137-Cs data, update the assumed 1700 CE event age to after 1650 CE, and provide new age estimates for event PA3 with bracketing detrital ages."

Further coring is suggested to confirm inundation distances.  TSL1 has a modern age from N18 (discarded), and is inferred to be 1700 CE because it is younger than 570-680 cal yr BP (N19, 47 cm).  Ages from Atwater (1992) from WA-M in the lower valley have large errors and target SUB2 (no tsunami sand in this core).  Youngest minimum is 850\u00b1130 radiocarbon yr BP, youngest maximum is 1080\u00b1130 radiocarbon yr BP.  In Neah Bay core N19, TDL2a has limiting minimum age of 700\u00b130  radiocarbon yr BP (but used in paper as maximum for SUB1 despite being stratigraphically closer to TDL2a).  In same core, the debris layer above TSL2b was sampled, it is unclear if this is a limiting minimum or maximum for SUB2b.

Two dates were derived from in-growth position Triglochin in inferred 1700 sand.": "Peterson et al. (2013) reports tsunami sands and organic-rich debris layers from 3-4 events found in the lower Waatch valley, inferred to mark inundation several km inland from the Hobuck side of the valley.  On the Neah Bay side, 4 tsunami sands are found in the back barrier wetlands, which record shorter inundation distances, but provide constraints on run-up heights. For TSL1, estimated run-up is 8.5 m NAVD88, TSL2b: 9.6 m, TSL3: 11.5 m.  Note: USGS and other coring efforts in 2016 had difficulty identifying sandy deposits for TSL1 and TSL2 in the lower valley (did not core deep enough to verify TSL3 in the lower valley).  Further coring is suggested to confirm inundation distances.  TSL1 has a modern age from N18 (discarded), and is inferred to be 1700 CE because it is younger than 570-680 cal yr BP (N19, 47 cm).  Ages from Atwater (1992) from WA-M in the lower valley have large errors and target SUB2 (no tsunami sand in this core).  Youngest minimum is 850\u00b1130 radiocarbon yr BP, youngest maximum is 1080\u00b1130 radiocarbon yr BP.  In Neah Bay core N19, TDL2a has limiting minimum age of 700\u00b130  radiocarbon yr BP (but used in paper as maximum for SUB1 despite being stratigraphically closer to TDL2a).  In same core, the debris layer above TSL2b was sampled, it is unclear if this is a limiting minimum or maximum for SUB2b. SUB3/TSL3 only has a close maximum age from the lower valley, core W12 ~5 cm below the contact, 1360\u00b140  radiocarbon yr BP."

Pearl) calibrated using OXcal 20. Darienzo and Peterson (1995) report three ages from Gallaway et al. (1992) for \"burial events\" 1, 3 and 6. Peterson et al. (1993), in a field trip guide, also summarize results of Gallaway et al. (1992). Notably, core CB115 studied by Gallaway contained 8 buried peats, not all associated with sand deposits. Three cores at site CB115 record 8 buried peats. An interesting detail: the second youngest sand deposit is interbedded with chaotic sediment interpreted to be a mudflow deposit (shaking coincident with tsunami?). The strongest evidence for tsunami inundation reported by Gallaway is published in Peterson et al. (2008). See below for further details.\n\nPeterson et al. (2008) and (2013): The 1964 tsunami is noted although a deposit recording the event is not. Radiocarbon data come from analyses of 8 samples of \"bulk organics within or immediately below\" sand layers identified in cores collected by Gallaway et al. (1992). Two other samples collected in 2006 (?) and dated by AMS method. \"Subsidence evidence... is weakly-developed or non-existent in most core sites.\" Along with tsunami sand layers, the paper identifies paleotsunami debris layers (TDL) from evidence of \"disseminated sand in detrital organics or mud\" inferred to reflect deposit at limit of a waning tsunami flow. Evidence for coseismic liquefaction included disturbed sand layers, clastic dikes, and sand sills observed in cores. However, liquefaction is not explicitly linked to tsunami events. GPR profiles interpreted to show tsunami scour. Sand ridge overtopping estimates assume a water depth of \u22641 m above the sand ridge elevation breached by tsunami flow. The estimate also assumes relative sea level was ~1 m lower during events #2, #3, and #4. Overtopping estimates include: <6 m for event #1; >8 m for #2; >8 m for #3; and >>8 m for #4.\n\nWitter (2008) and Witter et al. (2012): Mud-over-sand-over peat stratigraphy observed for sand sheets 1 and 3 suggest subsidence, but this study states that \"data are insufficient to provide conclusive evidence\" for subsidence. This study investigated the same deposits and sites that Peterson et al. (2008) studied. Conclusions are similar with the exception that sand sheet 4 is interpreted to record flooding along Ecola Creek. However, three cores in Pompey marsh contain a fourth sand deposit with beach sand provenance, which suggests marine inundation of limited extent.

(1993), in a field trip guide, also summarize results of Gallaway et al. (1992). Notably, core CB115 studied by Gallaway contained 8 buried peats, not all associated with sand deposits. Three cores at site CB115 record 8 buried peats. An interesting detail: the second youngest sand deposit is interbedded with chaotic sediment interpreted to be a mudflow deposit (shaking coincident with tsunami?).

(2008) and (2013): The 1964 tsunami is noted although a deposit recording the event is not. Radiocarbon data come from analyses of 8 samples of \"bulk organics within or immediately below\" sand layers identified in cores collected by Gallaway et al. (1992). Two other samples collected in 2006 (?) and dated by AMS method. \"Subsidence evidence... is weakly-developed or non-existent in most core sites.\" Along with tsunami sand layers, the paper identifies paleotsunami debris layers (TDL) from evidence of \"disseminated sand in detrital organics or mud\" inferred to reflect deposit at limit of a waning tsunami flow. Evidence for coseismic liquefaction included disturbed sand layers, clastic dikes, and sand sills observed in cores. However, liquefaction is not explicitly linked to tsunami events. GPR profiles interpreted to show tsunami scour. Sand ridge overtopping estimates assume a water depth of \u22641 m above the sand ridge elevation breached by tsunami flow. The estimate also assumes relative sea level was ~1 m lower during events #2, #3, and #4. Overtopping estimates include: <6 m for event #1; >8 m for #2; >8 m for #3; and >>8 m for #4.\n\nWitter (2008) and Witter et al. (2012): Mud-over-sand-over peat stratigraphy observed for sand sheets 1 and 3 suggest subsidence, but this study states that \"data are insufficient to provide conclusive evidence\" for subsidence. This study investigated the same deposits and sites that Peterson et al. (2008) studied. Conclusions are similar with the exception that sand sheet 4 is interpreted to record flooding along Ecola Creek. However, three cores in Pompey marsh contain a fourth sand deposit with beach sand provenance, which suggests marine inundation of limited extent.

In their report, the authors describe the uppermost 1.5 m of the stratigraphy in two cores as mostly peat and muddy peat, with three sand layers. The middle sand layer (about 50 cm depth) in one of the cores had three distinct normally graded land layers. The basal contact was sharp (? in the drawing), and the sand overlies peat. Above the sand, a there is a muddy peat. Diatoms indicate a change from freshwater to more saline species. In 2019, Hemphill-Haley et al. report a different stratigraphy of \"dominantly silty mud intercalated by four or five coarser grained deposits that consist of poorly sorted muddy to clean sand and muddy detritus-rich sand.\"  Diatom analysis suggests an environmental change from fresh to brackish marsh to brackish lagoon at about 89 cm depth that is suggestive of subsidence. A radiocarbon date from a woody detrial rich sand layer that overlies this potential subsidence contact is 280-0, in agreement with 1700 CE subsidence. The authors were not convinced that a sand that overlies the potential subsidence contact is a tsunami deposit, based on the lack of marine diatom species. Freshwater species in the sand deposit are more suggestive of storm inundation.  In Peterson et al. (2011), five inferred tsunami sand layers (TSL#2-TSL#6) documented in Figs. 7 and 8 of Peterson et al. (2011). Three of these layers ( TSL #s 2, 3,and 6) have bulk peats ages assigned to them. Peterson et al. (2011) found five sand layers below the inferred 1700 CE tsunami sand and that the peat ages suggest that these sand layers are all late Holocene , \u2264 3000 yrs BP."

Veins of sand were observed intersecting with layer U in one core, while veins of sand were observed in other cores but without context. More widespread evidence of liquefaction is likely present. For all of the sand layers, an overlying layer of woody debris was common with several cm of mud mixed with pieces of peat and wood were commonly seen overlying the package. This mud is interpreted as having been deposited out of suspension in days/weeks after the sand was deposited. All radiocarbon ages were on detrital materials in the overlying organic rick layers, except for bulk peat below layer Y, a tephra dated to 1010 cal yr BP below layer W."

Two dates were derived from in-growth position Triglochin in inferred 1700 sand.": "This site was originally studied by Carver et al. in 1999 as part of a study supported by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. In their report, the authors describe the uppermost 1.5 m of the stratigraphy as mostly peat and muddy peat, with three sand layers in two cores. The middle sand layer (about 50 cm depth) in one of the cores had three distinct normally graded land layers. The basal contact was sharp (? in drawing), and the sand overlies peat which is overlain by muddy peat. Diatoms indicated an environmental change across the peat to muddy peat contact from freshwater to brackish. In 2019, Hemphill-Haley et al. report a different stratigraphy of \"dominantly silty mud intercalated by four or five coarser grained deposits that consist of poorly sorted muddy to clean sand and muddy detritus-rich sand.\"  A contact at 89 cm depth is convincing as a subsidence event, with corroborating diatom evidence that show a change from fresh water marsh to lagoon environment.  A 10 cm detritus-rich sand layer at the subsidence contact is not convincing as a tsunami deposit because it contains primarily freshwater diatom species. The authors prefer a storm deposit interpretation for the sand layer. Two radiocarbon samples from the sand at the subsidence contact (twigs & spruce needles) have the same age of 0-290 cal yr BP,  suggesting the subsidence could be from the 1700 CE earthquake. This site is significant because of Native American oral histories of apparent earthquake and tsunami associated with it. Yurok Tribe stories of \u201cEarthquakes and Thunder\u201d and \u201cA Flood\u201d (Kroeber, 1976) describe shaking and a flood that washed the village of O\u2019rekw away. Another story from the book \u201cOreq-w: Orick Then and Now\u201d (Zuber and others, 1985, p. 22) describes a flooding event washing away the village. More details on the Yurok stories in both Carver et al., 1998 and Hemphill-Haley et al., 2019."
