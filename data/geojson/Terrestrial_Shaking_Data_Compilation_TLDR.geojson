All age estimates have been corrected approximately for erosion and missing varves (using average sedimentation rates and counts in at least two cores). Roughly half the debris flow deposits do not correlate temporally with megathrust source ages. Those that do overlap are interpreted as derived from Cascadia megathrust earthquakes, but characteristics of debris flows do not independently establish failure mechanism. Since age estimates are based on varve counts and sedimentation rates, then the method estimating the mean age and 2-sigma error potentially compounds error if the sedimentation rates are accurate estimates of varves. Reported age ranges in the paper use the year CE 2010 as the datum, which we have converted to standard reporting practices of calendar years before CE 1950."

Therefore, only the upper 4 events can be ranked as \"laterally extensive\"": "This paper focuses on the timing and mechanisms of megaturbidite generation in Lake Crescent. Megaturbidites A-D are interpreted as large lake disturbance events from major rock slides entering the lake, triggered by crustal earthquakes on the Lake Creek-Boundary Creek fault zone that runs through the lake system. The majority of material remobilized is likely from within the lake system, according to abundant lake diatom concentrations within megaturbidite layers. Megaturbidite A suggested to be sourced from the Sledgehammer Point Rockslide, near Mount Storm King, which would have likely produced a tsunami and subsequent seiche. Based on comparison with compiled historical landslide-generated tsunami data (Clark et al., 2015), the Sledgehammer Point Rockslide may have produced opposite-shore displacement wave up to 82-104 m in height. Megaturbidite B is thought to have originated from a slide that isolated Lake Crescent and Lake Sutherland and lead to lake level rise of ~24 meters, based on drowned tree chronologies (Pringle et al., 2010). Megaturbidite C may have originated from a southerly rockslide, and Megaturbidite D iwas possibly generated from a rockslide near Pyramid Peak.\nThere are also thinner turbidite layers identified but not carefully dated. These beds are 4-5 cm thick along the lake basin margins and thicken to 4-32 cm thick near the southern basin. Most of them are composed of 2-3 stacked fining upward layers. The sand is a miz of volcanic and sedimentary lithin provenance according to petrographic analyses."

Therefore, only the upper 4 events can be ranked as \"laterally extensive\"": "Bradley lake stratigraphy and paleoseismic evidence investigated by coring 27 sites along the lacustrine system. Several cores penetrate into sub-lacustrine strata and radiocarbon dating suggest that Bradley Lake was established ~7300 years ago. The outlet of Bradley lake is currently 5.5 m asl, the base is -4-5 m asl. 17 disturbance events are identified. 12 of the events are interpreted as coseismic CSZ tsunamis based on marine diatom evidence of seawater incursion, several of which are associated with lasting (years to decades) brackish diatom blooms. Disturbance event (DE) 3, 14, 15, 16 do not have evidence for marine seawater incursion, although DE16 is associated with a subsequent brackish diatom bloom. These events are therefore not likely tsunamis, but are instead interpreted as subaqueous slope failure during coseismic shaking. Calibrated ages from samples entered into \"Published Age\" column. Kelsey et al. provide OxCal modeled ages (using V-sequence), entered into \"Remodeled Age\" column"

The Chehakis dikes were only evident at distances >60 km from the coast, from which Obermeier infers that the liquefaction source was a \"local seismic source\". Additionally (and notably), the 1949 earthquake produced sand boils in Centralia WA (photograph in Chleborod and Schuster (1998). 12 sites along the Chehalis River are described in the manuscript, named CH-A through CH-M. At CH-I, a detrital charcoal fragment dated (1820\u00b160) from upper layer deposited after dike emplaced places a maximum limiting age on dike emplacmeent above top of dike.  At CH-J, charcoal fragments dated at contact of cap with source sands and gravels (3100\u00b1180) provide a maximum age of the host sediment, which predates the liquefaction. At CH-L, dikes are up to 30cm wide and may be associated with extensive slumping. 'Many' hemlock leaves dates to 3350 +60/-14 cal yr BP from contact of cap and sand/gravel liquefaction source. 4050+/-90 date from charcoal from soil onto which sand boil vented (max.)
