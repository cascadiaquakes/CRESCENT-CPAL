This contrasts with Briggs' (1994) core descriptions and analysis of cores >10 km from the sea, as compiled in detail by Leonard et al. (2010). For a discussion of Briggs' (1994) interpretations of similar cores in the Siuslaw River estuary, see the supplemental material for Nelson et al. (2020b). Most coastal paleoseismologist have avoided searching for evidence of coseismic subsidence in the Umpqua estuary because, as the largest river basin in the Oregon Coast Range, the estuary is strongly dominated by freshwater and large winter floods. Near and upriver from Highway 101, many marshes are probably underlain by largely freshwater peaty and muddy sediment.  Downriver from the highway much marsh sediment is sandy because of the extensive active and stabalized dune fields to the west along the coast. Thick sand beds, inferred to have been deposited by the 1700 CE tsunami, have been reported along the banks of Steamboat Island, but are hard to distinguish from fluvial sediment.\n"

                "Notes Record mainly of tsunami and marine incursion into lacustrine environment. Estimate subsidence of bedrock sill between lacustrine and marine environments based of qualitative microfossils, which are used as a salinity proxy. Microfossils in unit IV (which overlyies disturbance event III) show lasting increase in salinity that cannot be explained by marine incursion alone, thus interpret subsidence of bedrock sill. Unit I tentatively correlated to earthquake N (~2600), Unit III = earthquake S (~1600), Unit V = earthquake Y (1700 CE)": "Nelson's (1992) brief reconnaisance of tidal stratigraphy at sites in the lower Umpqua River estuary concluded that most contacts between muddy and peaty units were gradual and that no widespread evidence of sudden changes in RSL that were likely caused by coseismic subsidence of >0.5 m was preserved. This contrasts with Briggs' (1994) core descriptions and analysis of cores >10 km from the sea, as compiled in detail by Leonard et al. (2010). For a discussion of Briggs' (1994) interpretations of similar cores in the Siuslaw River estuary, see the supplemental material for Nelson et al. (2020b). Most coastal paleoseismologist have avoided searching for evidence of coseismic subsidence in the Umpqua estuary because, as the largest river basin in the Oregon Coast Range, the estuary is strongly dominated by freshwater and large winter floods. Near and upriver from Highway 101, many marshes are probably underlain by largely freshwater peaty and muddy sediment.  Downriver from the highway much marsh sediment is sandy because of the extensive active and stabalized dune fields to the west along the coast. Thick sand beds, inferred to have been deposited by the 1700 CE tsunami, have been reported along the banks of Steamboat Island, but are hard to distinguish from fluvial sediment.\n"

Estimate subsidence of bedrock sill between lacustrine and marine environments based of qualitative microfossils, which are used as a salinity proxy. Microfossils in unit IV (which overlyies disturbance event III) show lasting increase in salinity that cannot be explained by marine incursion alone, thus interpret subsidence of bedrock sill.

For contacts 4-5, there are abrupt changes from fibrous, woody peat to root-free mud across their upper contacts that is interpreted to record rapid, substantial rises in relative sea level. Foraminiferal and diatom assemblages across contacts 4 and 5 confirm that submergence changed high marshes into mud flats. Lithologic and microfossil data from couplet 6 record a similar gradual shoaling and development of a low and then high marsh. Microfossil assemblages near contact 7 reflect a gradual rather than sudden increase in the influence of marine water, despite the sharpness of the contact. This work interprets fluctuating brackish to fresh-brackish intertidal environment from about 4600 to 2900 yr ago. The lack of foraminiferal samples from the lower portions of the cores and the small numbers of valves (aside from P. sulcata) in the diatom samples preclude using assemblage data to estimate the amount of relative sea level change across contacts 8 and 9.

Microfossil analysis qualitatively suggests minimal subsidence at this site is required to explain change faunal shift High energy lacustrine depositional event. Microfossil analysis qualitatively suggests moderate-high subsidence at this site is required to explain change faunal shift": "Carver et al. (1998) describe three sand sheets, the middle sand with three normally-graded layers. The middle sand sharply overlies peat (at about 50 cm depth), and has muddy peat above it, a change in environment suggestive of subsidence, and confirmed by diatoms. Hemphill-Haley et al. (2019) describe a different dominantly silty mud with 4-5 coarser detritus-rich depostis. A contact at 89 cm depth is interpreted as a subsidence event, corroborated by diatoms. A 10 cm muddy sand at the subsidence contact is interpreted as a storm deposit rather than a tsunami deposit.",
