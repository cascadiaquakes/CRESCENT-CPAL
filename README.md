# CRESCENT-CPAL

**CRESCENT-CPAL** is a repository developed to support the Cascadia Paleoseismology Working Group ([CPAL](https://cascadiaquakes.org/cpal/)) within the [CRESCENT project](https://cascadiaquakes.org/). This repository provides data and tools for geoscientists working with CPAL data.

## Features

### **Data Files** 

- The original data files are in Microsoft Excel format and are stored in the `excel/` folder.
- These files are converted to GeoJSON format for web-based visualization and are stored in the `geojson/` folder.
- Corresponding JSON files that provide field descriptions and column display controls for the web interface are stored in the `json/` folder.

### **Scripts** 

Under the `scripts` directory, two `Python` helper tools are provided to convert the data and description files to the corresponding `GeoJSON` and `JSON` files respectively. For information on how to use these scripts, see the guides under the scripts directory.
