                "Notes": "This site is a small basin site, with a  high cliff to the east that is the sediment source, called Hydrate Ridge.  The cliff face is 9 km in length and 1400 meters vertically, with an average slope of 9.9 degrees.   The ridge top is at 800m.  The ridge is a seaward-vergent thrust, with most of the west-facing forelimb missing due to failure and erosion (Godfinger et al., Trehu et al., Johnson et al.).This site was the subject of numerous ALVIN dives in which the character of the open slope is observed, and video of this exists.  Teh video and GEOMAR camera tows show (Bohrmann et al) the ridge top is coverd in a carapace of overlapping and deformed carbonates, and the open fase is loose uncolidated sand.  The HRBW cores form an E-W transect, from proximal to the cliff, medim distance, and more distal in teh basin.  Proximal cores have a high resolution expandes sectiosn ! 1500 years in length.  Medial cores have a full Holocene section, and the distal core has a compaced thin section extendin well into teh Pleistocene.  All cores at this site have what appears to be a steady rain of silty sandy materisl, presumably from the nearby cliff, making turbidite tail boundary calls more difficult.  This site also as a higher than typical number of thin wispy  lamellae, perhaps also due to priximal source, or to other causes.   The site isolation likely reduces the turbidity current sources to: Self failure, gas hydrate destabilization events, and crustal, slab or plate boundary earthquakes.  This site is a fully isolated basin, ringed on all sides by high ridges.  Lowest pass elevation into this basin is too high for intrusion of turbidity currents external to the site (400m, north side).  There are no other obvious canyon or channel pathward leading in the direction of this site.  "

The cliff face is 9 km in length and 1400 meters vertically, with an average slope of 9.9 degrees.   The ridge top is at 800m.  The ridge is a seaward-vergent thrust, with most of the west-facing forelimb missing due to failure and erosion (Godfinger et al., Trehu et al., Johnson et al.).This site was the subject of numerous ALVIN dives in which the character of the open slope is observed, and video of this exists.  Teh video and GEOMAR camera tows show (Bohrmann et al) the ridge top is coverd in a carapace of overlapping and deformed carbonates, and the open fase is loose uncolidated sand.  The HRBW cores form an E-W transect, from proximal to the cliff, medim distance, and more distal in teh basin.  Proximal cores have a high resolution expandes sectiosn ! 1500 years in length.  Medial cores have a full Holocene section, and the distal core has a compaced thin section extendin well into teh Pleistocene.  All cores at this site have what appears to be a steady rain of silty sandy materisl, presumably from the nearby cliff, making turbidite tail boundary calls more difficult.  This site also as a higher than typical number of thin wispy  lamellae, perhaps also due to priximal source, or to other causes.   The site isolation likely reduces the turbidity current sources to: Self failure, gas hydrate destabilization events, and crustal, slab or plate boundary earthquakes.  This site is a fully isolated basin, ringed on all sides by high ridges.  Lowest pass elevation into this basin is too high for intrusion of turbidity currents external to the site (400m, north side).  There are no other obvious canyon or channel pathward leading in the direction of this site.  "

The cliff face is 9 km in length and 1400 meters vertically, with an average slope of 9.9 degrees.   The ridge top is at 800m.  The ridge is a seaward-vergent thrust, with most of the west-facing forelimb missing due to failure and erosion (Godfinger et al., Trehu et al., Johnson et al.).This site was the subject of numerous ALVIN dives in which the character of the open slope is observed, and video of this exists.  Teh video and GEOMAR camera tows show (Bohrmann et al) the ridge top is coverd in a carapace of overlapping and deformed carbonates, and the open fase is loose uncolidated sand.  The HRBW cores form an E-W transect, from proximal to the cliff, medim distance, and more distal in teh basin.  Proximal cores have a high resolution expandes sectiosn ! 1500 years in length.  Medial cores have a full Holocene section, and the distal core has a compaced thin section extendin well into teh Pleistocene.  All cores at this site have what appears to be a steady rain of silty sandy materisl, presumably from the nearby cliff, making turbidite tail boundary calls more difficult.  This site also as a higher than typical number of thin wispy  lamellae, perhaps also due to priximal source, or to other causes.   The site isolation likely reduces the turbidity current sources to: Self failure, gas hydrate destabilization events, and crustal, slab or plate boundary earthquakes.  This site is a fully isolated basin, ringed on all sides by high ridges.  Lowest pass elevation into this basin is too high for intrusion of turbidity currents external to the site (400m, north side).  There are no other obvious canyon or channel pathward leading in the direction of this site.  "

The cliff face is 9 km in length and 1400 meters vertically, with an average slope of 9.9 degrees.   The ridge top is at 800m.  The ridge is a seaward-vergent thrust, with most of the west-facing forelimb missing due to failure and erosion (Godfinger et al., Trehu et al., Johnson et al.).This site was the subject of numerous ALVIN dives in which the character of the open slope is observed, and video of this exists.  Teh video and GEOMAR camera tows show (Bohrmann et al) the ridge top is coverd in a carapace of overlapping and deformed carbonates, and the open fase is loose uncolidated sand.  The HRBW cores form an E-W transect, from proximal to the cliff, medim distance, and more distal in teh basin.  Proximal cores have a high resolution expandes sectiosn ! 1500 years in length.  Medial cores have a full Holocene section, and the distal core has a compaced thin section extendin well into teh Pleistocene.  All cores at this site have what appears to be a steady rain of silty sandy materisl, presumably from the nearby cliff, making turbidite tail boundary calls more difficult.  This site also as a higher than typical number of thin wispy  lamellae, perhaps also due to priximal source, or to other causes.   The site isolation likely reduces the turbidity current sources to: Self failure, gas hydrate destabilization events, and crustal, slab or plate boundary earthquakes.  This site is a fully isolated basin, ringed on all sides by high ridges.  Lowest pass elevation into this basin is too high for intrusion of turbidity currents external to the site (400m, north side).  There are no other obvious canyon or channel pathward leading in the direction of this site.  "

The cliff face is 9 km in length and 1400 meters vertically, with an average slope of 9.9 degrees.   The ridge top is at 800m.  The ridge is a seaward-vergent thrust, with most of the west-facing forelimb missing due to failure and erosion (Godfinger et al., Trehu et al., Johnson et al.).This site was the subject of numerous ALVIN dives in which the character of the open slope is observed, and video of this exists.  Teh video and GEOMAR camera tows show (Bohrmann et al) the ridge top is coverd in a carapace of overlapping and deformed carbonates, and the open fase is loose uncolidated sand.  The HRBW cores form an E-W transect, from proximal to the cliff, medim distance, and more distal in teh basin.  Proximal cores have a high resolution expandes sectiosn ! 1500 years in length.  Medial cores have a full Holocene section, and the distal core has a compaced thin section extendin well into teh Pleistocene.  All cores at this site have what appears to be a steady rain of silty sandy materisl, presumably from the nearby cliff, making turbidite tail boundary calls more difficult.  This site also as a higher than typical number of thin wispy  lamellae, perhaps also due to priximal source, or to other causes.   The site isolation likely reduces the turbidity current sources to: Self failure, gas hydrate destabilization events, and crustal, slab or plate boundary earthquakes.  This site is a fully isolated basin, ringed on all sides by high ridges.  Lowest pass elevation into this basin is too high for intrusion of turbidity currents external to the site (400m, north side).  There are no other obvious canyon or channel pathward leading in the direction of this site.  "

The cliff face is 9 km in length and 1400 meters vertically, with an average slope of 9.9 degrees.   The ridge top is at 800m.  The ridge is a seaward-vergent thrust, with most of the west-facing forelimb missing due to failure and erosion (Godfinger et al., Trehu et al., Johnson et al.).This site was the subject of numerous ALVIN dives in which the character of the open slope is observed, and video of this exists.  Teh video and GEOMAR camera tows show (Bohrmann et al) the ridge top is coverd in a carapace of overlapping and deformed carbonates, and the open fase is loose uncolidated sand.  The HRBW cores form an E-W transect, from proximal to the cliff, medim distance, and more distal in teh basin.  Proximal cores have a high resolution expandes sectiosn ! 1500 years in length.  Medial cores have a full Holocene section, and the distal core has a compaced thin section extendin well into teh Pleistocene.  All cores at this site have what appears to be a steady rain of silty sandy materisl, presumably from the nearby cliff, making turbidite tail boundary calls more difficult.  This site also as a higher than typical number of thin wispy  lamellae, perhaps also due to priximal source, or to other causes.   The site isolation likely reduces the turbidity current sources to: Self failure, gas hydrate destabilization events, and crustal, slab or plate boundary earthquakes.  This site is a fully isolated basin, ringed on all sides by high ridges.  Lowest pass elevation into this basin is too high for intrusion of turbidity currents external to the site (400m, north side).

                "Notes": "This site is a small basin site, with a  high cliff to the east that is the sediment source, called Hydrate Ridge.  The cliff face is 9 km in length and 1400 meters vertically, with an average slope of 9.9 degrees.   The ridge top is at 800m.  The ridge is a seaward-vergent thrust, with most of the west-facing forelimb missing due to failure and erosion (Godfinger et al., Trehu et al., Johnson et al.).This site was the subject of numerous ALVIN dives in which the character of the open slope is observed, and video of this exists.  Teh video and GEOMAR camera tows show (Bohrmann et al) the ridge top is coverd in a carapace of overlapping and deformed carbonates, and the open fase is loose uncolidated sand.  The HRBW cores form an E-W transect, from proximal to the cliff, medim distance, and more distal in teh basin.  Proximal cores have a high resolution expandes sectiosn ! 1500 years in length.  Medial cores have a full Holocene section, and the distal core has a compaced thin section extendin well into teh Pleistocene.  All cores at this site have what appears to be a steady rain of silty sandy materisl, presumably from the nearby cliff, making turbidite tail boundary calls more difficult.  This site also as a higher than typical number of thin wispy  lamellae, perhaps also due to priximal source, or to other causes.   The site isolation likely reduces the turbidity current sources to: Self failure, gas hydrate destabilization events, and crustal, slab or plate boundary earthquakes.  This site is a fully isolated basin, ringed on all sides by high ridges.  Lowest pass elevation into this basin is too high for intrusion of turbidity currents external to the site (400m, north side).  There are no other obvious canyon or channel pathward leading in the direction of this site.  "

                "Notes": "This site is comprised of a collection of cores in distal Cascadia deep-sea Channel.  It was chosen because there were existing records there from Griggs 1968.  Cascadia channel is formed beolw the confluence of Juan de Fuca and Willapa channels, with input further down stream from other tributaries from Nitinat Fan and Vancouver sea valley which may be largely relict during the Holocene.  Below the confluence it extends 340 km tohte Blanco Fracture Zone, and through it to the Tufts abyssal plain.  The channel is deeply incised, up to 80-100 m deep along the reach north of the core sites, whcih are midway between the confluence and the BFZ.  This makes the turbidity current passage a highly constrained conduit setting.  Perhaps not coincidentally, basal erosion in the event beds is more common in these cores than other sites, likely due to higher velocities.  Aspects of this are discussed in Griggs, (1968).  The erosion makes some age determinations less reliable, though corrections are possible with the multiple cores available.  Otherwise this is a high resolution, high fidelity site that captures many exquisite bed details, and has prominent tan colored hemipleagic sediment, with a very stable interevent sedimentation rate which relfects expected downcore compaction, which is not corrected for.

The canyon is likely relict with respect to Holocene recharge, but may act as a partial conduit for shaking events nontheless.  The Klamath Apron is a very thin apron like Rogue Apron, but barely discernable a the resolution existing multibeam and sidescan data.  The Smith cores are high resolution and expanded records, covering ~ 9800 years in 8 m of core.  However, the grain size and event bed overall densities are relatively low, making the medum to thinner event beds more difficut to interpret.  This is more so in the late Holocene, as sediment supply appears to weaken as it does at many deep water sites with no modern recharge upslope.  The result is thin beds are more bioturbated.  Klamath also is the northern limit of a facies change with respect to turbidite frequency.  The lower half of the cores contain a much higher event frequency than the upper half, a marked and abrupt change.  This change is observed in all cores south of Klamath, and discussed to some extent in Goldfinger et al. (2012, 2013, 2021). The origins of this shift are not fully understood however.  "
