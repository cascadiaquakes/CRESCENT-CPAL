All age estimates have been corrected approximately for erosion and missing varves (using average sedimentation rates and counts in at least two cores). Roughly half the debris flow deposits do not correlate temporally with megathrust source ages. Those that do overlap are interpreted as derived from Cascadia megathrust earthquakes, but characteristics of debris flows do not independently establish failure mechanism. Since age estimates are based on varve counts and sedimentation rates, then the method estimating the mean age and 2-sigma error potentially compounds error if the sedimentation rates are accurate estimates of varves. Reported age ranges in the paper use the year CE 2010 as the datum, which we have converted to standard reporting practices of calendar years before CE 1950."

                "Notes": "Lake Ozette has a record of 33-34 inferred seismically-generated events going back 14.2 kyr B.P, 16 events which occur above the Mazama ash layer. The first 12 events are dated in the Brothers et al. (2024) manuscript using an OxCal Sequence and P_Sequence model - the Sequence model ages are entered here. The earlier events are presented in Brothers et al. (2024) SSA abstract, to be finalized and published in a peer-reviewed source subsequently. The MTDs in Ozette Lake are identifiable within cores as sandier layers and also as high amplitude reflections in Chirp data. Estimated shaking from megathrust and crustal fault sources nearby suggest that Ozette Lake turbidites are likely generated from CSZ events, however there is a possibility that a larger rupture than anticipated on the Lake Creek - Boundary Creek/Sadie Creek fault zone can generate lake turbidites as well."

Megaturbidites A-D are interpreted as large lake disturbance events from major rock slides entering the lake, triggered by crustal earthquakes on the Lake Creek-Boundary Creek fault zone that runs through the lake system. The majority of material remobilized is likely from within the lake system, according to abundant lake diatom concentrations within megaturbidite layers. Megaturbidite A suggested to be sourced from the Sledgehammer Point Rockslide, near Mount Storm King, which would have likely produced a tsunami and subsequent seiche. Based on comparison with compiled historical landslide-generated tsunami data (Clark et al., 2015), the Sledgehammer Point Rockslide may have produced opposite-shore displacement wave up to 82-104 m in height. Megaturbidite B is thought to have originated from a slide that isolated Lake Crescent and Lake Sutherland and lead to lake level rise of ~24 meters, based on drowned tree chronologies (Pringle et al., 2010). Megaturbidite C may have originated from a southerly rockslide, and Megaturbidite D iwas possibly generated from a rockslide near Pyramid Peak.\nThere are also thinner turbidite layers identified but not carefully dated. These beds are 4-5 cm thick along the lake basin margins and thicken to 4-32 cm thick near the southern basin. Most of them are composed of 2-3 stacked fining upward layers. The sand is a miz of volcanic and sedimentary lithin provenance according to petrographic analyses."

Megaturbidites A-D are interpreted as large lake disturbance events from major rock slides entering the lake, triggered by crustal earthquakes on the Lake Creek-Boundary Creek fault zone that runs through the lake system. The majority of material remobilized is likely from within the lake system, according to abundant lake diatom concentrations within megaturbidite layers. Megaturbidite A suggested to be sourced from the Sledgehammer Point Rockslide, near Mount Storm King, which would have likely produced a tsunami and subsequent seiche. Based on comparison with compiled historical landslide-generated tsunami data (Clark et al., 2015), the Sledgehammer Point Rockslide may have produced opposite-shore displacement wave up to 82-104 m in height. Megaturbidite B is thought to have originated from a slide that isolated Lake Crescent and Lake Sutherland and lead to lake level rise of ~24 meters, based on drowned tree chronologies (Pringle et al., 2010). Megaturbidite C may have originated from a southerly rockslide, and Megaturbidite D iwas possibly generated from a rockslide near Pyramid Peak.\nThere are also thinner turbidite layers identified but not carefully dated. These beds are 4-5 cm thick along the lake basin margins and thicken to 4-32 cm thick near the southern basin. Most of them are composed of 2-3 stacked fining upward layers. The sand is a miz of volcanic and sedimentary lithin provenance according to petrographic analyses."

                "Notes": "Comparison of Bull Run age estimates and plate boundary megathrust earthquakes shows close overlap for many interpreted full margin events, except for T6a, T7a, T8a, T8b, T10e, and T12a. These are smaller events with associated rupture patch constrained to southern Cascadia. T10b, however is a supposedly longer rupture including SW Washington that does not correlate to an event within Bull Run Lake. Ages were assessed using OxCAL P-Sequence modeling and stratigraphic positioning, radiocarbon data is limited."

Additionally (and notably), the 1949 earthquake produced sand boils in Centralia WA (photograph in Chleborod and Schuster (1998). 12 sites along the Chehalis River are described in the manuscript, named CH-A through CH-M. At CH-I, a detrital charcoal fragment dated (1820\u00b160) from upper layer deposited after dike emplaced places a maximum limiting age on dike emplacmeent above top of dike.  At CH-J, charcoal fragments dated at contact of cap with source sands and gravels (3100\u00b1180) provide a maximum age of the host sediment, which predates the liquefaction. At CH-L, dikes are up to 30cm wide and may be associated with extensive slumping. 'Many' hemlock leaves dates to 3350 +60/-14 cal yr BP from contact of cap and sand/gravel liquefaction source. 4050+/-90 date from charcoal from soil onto which sand boil vented (max.)

                "Notes": "The intact sea stacks, rock pillars, and precariously balanced rocks investigated by McPhillips and Scharer (2021) are features that have not been toppled from seismic shaking since their formation. The features therefore represent maximum shaking intensities that have not been exceeded. The features are not directly dated, but age estimates relate to generally how many earthquake cycles the features have experienced. The PGA maxima are relevant for one or more past megathrust earthquakes, depending on the time period for which fragile features have existed."
