For contacts 4-5, there are abrupt changes from fibrous, woody peat to root-free mud across their upper contacts that is interpreted to record rapid, substantial rises in relative sea level. Foraminiferal and diatom assemblages across contacts 4 and 5 confirm that submergence changed high marshes into mud flats. Lithologic and microfossil data from couplet 6 record a similar gradual shoaling and development of a low and then high marsh. Microfossil assemblages near contact 7 reflect a gradual rather than sudden increase in the influence of marine water, despite the sharpness of the contact. This work interprets fluctuating brackish to fresh-brackish intertidal environment from about 4600 to 2900 yr ago. The lack of foraminiferal samples from the lower portions of the cores and the small numbers of valves (aside from P. sulcata) in the diatom samples preclude using assemblage data to estimate the amount of relative sea level change across contacts 8 and 9. Contact 10 was not sampled due to deformation of the lowest 30 cm of the core during coring."

For contacts 4-5, there are abrupt changes from fibrous, woody peat to root-free mud across their upper contacts that is interpreted to record rapid, substantial rises in relative sea level. Foraminiferal and diatom assemblages across contacts 4 and 5 confirm that submergence changed high marshes into mud flats. Lithologic and microfossil data from couplet 6 record a similar gradual shoaling and development of a low and then high marsh. Microfossil assemblages near contact 7 reflect a gradual rather than sudden increase in the influence of marine water, despite the sharpness of the contact. This work interprets fluctuating brackish to fresh-brackish intertidal environment from about 4600 to 2900 yr ago. The lack of foraminiferal samples from the lower portions of the cores and the small numbers of valves (aside from P. sulcata) in the diatom samples preclude using assemblage data to estimate the amount of relative sea level change across contacts 8 and 9. Contact 10 was not sampled due to deformation of the lowest 30 cm of the core during coring."

For the inferred 1700 CE event, mean estimates range between 0.24 - 1.00 across all sites. Estimates from McDaniel and Jacoby creeks are the highest, and Mad River Slough estimates tend to be lower. For the second event ~875 cal yr BP, subsidence estimates had little variation, about 0.07 m. For the third event ~1120 cal yr BP, intersite variability was moderate, up to 0.41 m, with Mad River Slough recording lesser amounts of subsidence than McDaniel or Jacoby Creeks."

The MRS E1 contact was dated with multiple high precision ages by Nelson et al., 1995.

Evidence for submergence during E5 is not as widespread at MRS; although there are roots in buried peat horizon."
