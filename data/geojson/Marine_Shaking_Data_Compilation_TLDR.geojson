The cliff face is 9 km in length and 1400 meters vertically, with an average slope of 9.9 degrees.   The ridge top is at 800m.  The ridge is a seaward-vergent thrust, with most of the west-facing forelimb missing due to failure and erosion (Godfinger et al., Trehu et al., Johnson et al.).This site was the subject of numerous ALVIN dives in which the character of the open slope is observed, and video of this exists.

The cliff face is 9 km in length and 1400 meters vertically, with an average slope of 9.9 degrees.   The ridge top is at 800m.  The ridge is a seaward-vergent thrust, with most of the west-facing forelimb missing due to failure and erosion (Godfinger et al., Trehu et al., Johnson et al.).This site was the subject of numerous ALVIN dives in which the character of the open slope is observed, and video of this exists.

Medial cores have a full Holocene section, and the distal core has a compaced thin section extendin well into teh Pleistocene.  All cores at this site have what appears to be a steady rain of silty sandy materisl, presumably from the nearby cliff, making turbidite tail boundary calls more difficult.  This site also as a higher than typical number of thin wispy  lamellae, perhaps also due to priximal source, or to other causes.   The site isolation likely reduces the turbidity current sources to: Self failure, gas hydrate destabilization events, and crustal, slab or plate boundary earthquakes.

Lowest pass elevation into this basin is too high for intrusion of turbidity currents external to the site (400m, north side).

It was chosen because there were existing records there from Griggs 1968.  Cascadia channel is formed beolw the confluence of Juan de Fuca and Willapa channels, with input further down stream from other tributaries from Nitinat Fan and Vancouver sea valley which may be largely relict during the Holocene.  Below the confluence it extends 340 km tohte Blanco Fracture Zone, and through it to the Tufts abyssal plain.  The channel is deeply incised, up to 80-100 m deep along the reach north of the core sites, whcih are midway between the confluence and the BFZ.  This makes the turbidity current passage a highly constrained conduit setting.  Perhaps not coincidentally, basal erosion in the event beds is more common in these cores than other sites, likely due to higher velocities.  Aspects of this are discussed in Griggs, (1968).  The erosion makes some age determinations less reliable, though corrections are possible with the multiple cores available.  Otherwise this is a high resolution, high fidelity site that captures many exquisite bed details, and has prominent tan colored hemipleagic sediment, with a very stable interevent sedimentation rate which relfects expected downcore compaction, which is not corrected for.

(2012) noted the site likely contains few if any terestrally souorced event beds, at least one major hyperpycnal flow was likely required to deposit the Mazama ash on Rogue Apron.     "

The overlying section is composed of interbedded hemipelagic mud, turbidite sands and silts, and remoulded and reworked slimp materials.Delta R correction was modified from the global deltaR, so applied a custom deltaR. in preferred age model (fig 17b), using event free depth, delta R = 0. fig 17 c, delta r = 420, put top of core into the future. and did not fit with effingham (plant based ages) as well. so, forams offshore at slipstream are only 400 yrs old, not 800 yrs old. john southon, using salmon scales and 13C, disagrees. so, the data fit with modern carbon better (so preferred delta R = 0 +- 50). Turbidites interbedded with hemipelagic mud overlying late Pleistocene diamicton and Glauconitic biogenic ooze. Transect of cores from proximal to distal (abysal plain) have facies that trend with coarses sandy turbidites near the headwall and bigger failure events contain larger particles and ripup clasts clasts and have Bouma A through D, transitioning to bouma E, upward fining sequences, and debris flow facies. bedded from cm to 10s of cm. Distal turbidites are more finer grained, bouma B sand to silt beds, but still mud clasts. thickness of sandy units may relate to duration of shaking. turbidite frequency is higher in lower section.": "Rogue Apron is a thin constructional apron on the abyssal plain at the mouth of Rogue Canyon.  The apron is fairly smooth and the scale of the multibeam sonars of the era, and has several subtle distributary channels which did not influence sampling location. Rogue Canyon has four primary tributary arms on the mid to upper slope which merge in the lowest reach.  The upper canyon heads (4) range from 15 -26 km from the coast, providing good isolation from the Rogue River.  It should be noted that although Goldfinger et al. (2012) noted the site likely contains few if any terestrally souorced event beds, at least one major hyperpycnal flow was likely required to deposit the Mazama ash on Rogue Apron.     "

The Smith cores are high resolution and expanded records, covering ~ 9800 years in 8 m of core.  However, the grain size and event bed overall densities are relatively low, making the medum to thinner event beds more difficut to interpret.  This is more so in the late Holocene, as sediment supply appears to weaken as it does at many deep water sites with no modern recharge upslope.  The result is thin beds are more bioturbated.  Klamath also is the northern limit of a facies change with respect to turbidite frequency.  The lower half of the cores contain a much higher event frequency than the upper half, a marked and abrupt change.  This change is observed in all cores south of Klamath, and discussed to some extent in Goldfinger et al. (2012, 2013, 2021). The origins of this shift are not fully understood however.  "

On the lower slope the canyon loses it's coherence and merges with submarine slides the active strucures, making it a diffuse source, likely mixing with open slope sources as noted by Hill et al., (2020).

The Klamath Apron is a very thin apron like Rogue Apron, but barely discernable a the resolution existing multibeam and sidescan data.  The Smith cores are high resolution and expanded records, covering ~ 9800 years in 8 m of core.  However, the grain size and event bed overall densities are relatively low, making the medum to thinner event beds more difficut to interpret.  This is more so in the late Holocene, as sediment supply appears to weaken as it does at many deep water sites with no modern recharge upslope.  The result is thin beds are more bioturbated.  Klamath also is the northern limit of a facies change with respect to turbidite frequency.  The lower half of the cores contain a much higher event frequency than the upper half, a marked and abrupt change.

Distal turbidites are more finer grained, bouma B sand to silt beds, but still mud clasts. thickness of sandy units may relate to duration of shaking. turbidite frequency is higher in lower section.": "Klamath Canyon is a small discontinuous canyon likely associated with the Klamath River, CA.  On the lower slope the canyon loses it's coherence and merges with submarine slides the active strucures, making it a diffuse source, likely mixing with open slope sources as noted by Hill et al., (2020).  The canyon is likely relict with respect to Holocene recharge, but may act as a partial conduit for shaking events nontheless.  The Klamath Apron is a very thin apron like Rogue Apron, but barely discernable a the resolution existing multibeam and sidescan data.  The Smith cores are high resolution and expanded records, covering ~ 9800 years in 8 m of core.  However, the grain size and event bed overall densities are relatively low, making the medum to thinner event beds more difficut to interpret.  This is more so in the late Holocene, as sediment supply appears to weaken as it does at many deep water sites with no modern recharge upslope.  The result is thin beds are more bioturbated.  Klamath also is the northern limit of a facies change with respect to turbidite frequency.  The lower half of the cores contain a much higher event frequency than the upper half, a marked and abrupt change.  This change is observed in all cores south of Klamath, and discussed to some extent in Goldfinger et al. (2012, 2013, 2021). The origins of this shift are not fully understood however.  "

Transect of cores from proximal to distal (abysal plain) have facies that trend with coarses sandy turbidites near the headwall and bigger failure events contain larger particles and ripup clasts clasts and have Bouma A through D, transitioning to bouma E, upward fining sequences, and debris flow facies. bedded from cm to 10s of cm. Distal turbidites are more finer grained, bouma B sand to silt beds, but still mud clasts. thickness of sandy units may relate to duration of shaking. turbidite frequency is higher in lower section.": "Eel channel system is sand rich, similar to Trinidad system. Cores show numerous, thin, graded-sand turbidite beds. Given the lack of hemipelagic material in proximal cores, distal cores were used to identify and date horizons. 51 turidites were identified in core 41PC, most ages are from the same core, giving an average turbidite recurrence of 60-70 years. Several out of sequence ages underlie interpreted T7 turbidite and above T8."
